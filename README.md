MEDIG is a MERN-stack medical record and history management system designed to securely store, update, and retrieve patient medical data. The platform supports authenticated user access, structured medical history tracking, secure document uploads, and automated PDF report generation. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT-based authentication, while the frontend is developed with React. This project was developed as an academic prototype to demonstrate full-stack system design, secure data handling, and medical data workflows.
